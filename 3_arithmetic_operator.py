# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# a=5 b=2,       1. a+b             2. a-b           3. a*b
